# Webpack ERROR in JSON file, Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ;

I recently was developing a simple React app and decided to use the ES6 `import { data } from 'testData.json'` to load the JSON data into my application.  Webpack was outputting `ERROR in ./lib/testData.json Module build failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ; (2:8)`.  

Initially, I could not think what was causing this, turned out that the mistake was in my `webpack.config.js` file.  The JavaScript `babel-loader` module rule was missing the `$` in the `test` regular expressions, and therefore, correctly Webpack was passing `babel-loader` my `testData.json` file.
