The new [iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) is the first iPad since the [iPad 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(3rd_generation) that has encouraged me to buy one.  The key features are:
* [Apple Pencil](http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/)
* [12.9" Retina Display](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/design/)
* 10 hour battery life
* [iOS 9 Split View](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/ios9/)

Key apps:
* [duet](http://www.duetdisplay.com/)
* [Safari Queue](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/11/18/safari-queue-offline-reading-watching-ios-now-available/)

Over the summer 2015 I moved from the [Dell XPS 15](http://www.dell.com/uk/p/xps-15-9530/pd?oc=cnx9526) to a [MacBook Pro 15 Retina](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP719?locale=en_US) as I am spending a lot of time developing Node.js applications and the experience on Windows8 is horrible with the fundamental [Windows file path length issue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx).

While I am delighted with the move to the rMBP15, in the process I lost the ability to use the very portable 15.6" 1080p USB monitor, the [ASUS MB168B+](https://www.asus.com/uk/Monitors/MB168BPlus/).
