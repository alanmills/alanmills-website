Idea is that you use available software development metrics to predict software problems and therefore pre-emptively fix problems before your customers find them.

Available metrics:
* When code was developed
* What development language
* Who did the development
* Lines of code
* Cyclomatic complexity
* Number of defects
* Library dependencies
* others

Leveraging 'R'/'Hadoop'? we can create a predictive model that can track the performance of the development team and predict which parts of the code base are the problem areas that require the team to put in pro-active maintenance (refactoring, measurement, etc).
