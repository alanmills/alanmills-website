I am loving my [Dell XPS 15](http://amzn.to/1MOQnj9) with it's built-in HDPI display.  I am not loving Windows 7 support for mixed Standard and High DPI monitor support (read, no usable support).

To get round this issue and enjoy a purely [Retina Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display) world, I purchased:
* Two amazing [Dell UP2414Q Ultra Sharp 24" 4K Monitors](http://amzn.to/1MORu2v),
* One [Dell D3100 USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station](http://amzn.to/1UEw6iT) - can drive simultaneously 2 Full HD Monitors and 1 Ultra HD 4K Monitor.

To make this work you have to:
* Install the latests [DisplayLink drivers](http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/windows)
* Attached one UP2414Q to the XPS
* Attach the other UP2414Q to the D3100.

As well as enjoying the benefits of dual 4K 24" displays, you can use the XPS in-built HDPI monitor (near 4K) for a triple display setup and the D3100 as a docking station:
* USB hub
  * 3 x SuperSpeed USB 3.0 - 9 pin USB Type A
  * 2 X USB 2.0 - 4 pin USB Type A
* Headphones - mini-stereo 3.5 mm
* Audio out - mini-stereo 3.5 mm
* Gigabit Ethernet - RJ-45
