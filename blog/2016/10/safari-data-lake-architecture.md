Swimming in the data lake
-------------------------

Big data, lot of data and standard data management systems are not working.

### One way data lake or the garbage dump

They are building data lake but the organisations are finding that they can get anything from these.  This is a problem because building a data lake costs a lot of money and the organisations are not getting value from the data in the lake as the source for information discovery.


Over time the data lake can become a garbage dump, this is really common.  This becomes something know as a **one way data lake**  as data goes in and nothing comes out!

### How to solve
* Repetitive data
* Non-repetitive data
