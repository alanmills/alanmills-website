After watching the [BBC Panorama program, The Trouble With Our Trains](http://bbc.in/2ePcvux) first broadcast on the 7 November 2016 19:30.  I decided that I would share my experiences over the first 3 months of commuting to London by electric car.

I recommend you watch the program if you have not had the horrible experience of commuting by train and in particular into London using the woeful [National Rail service](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk).

At the beginning of August of 2016, I started a new job in the [City of London](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk) for [Informa BI](http://www.informa.com/divisions/business-intelligence/).  While planning how I was going to deal with the daily commute and not wanting to deal with the incredibly expensive, unreliable, dilapidated and overcrowded train service run by the equally terrible [Abellio Greater Anglia](https://www.greateranglia.co.uk), I came up with the crazy idea to travel by road!
