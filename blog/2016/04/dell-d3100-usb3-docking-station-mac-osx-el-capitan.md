Prior to moving to the [Apple Retina MacBook Pro 15](http://amzn.to/1MOQICz), I was running a [Dell XPS, Windows 7 dual/tripple 4K setup](../../2015/02/dell-xps-up24114q-d3100-dual-4k-monitors.md).

When I moved to the rMBP, due to the poor DisplayLink driver support and the dual Thunderbolt ports on the rMPB, I put the [D3100](http://amzn.to/1UEw6iT) back in its box and forgot about it.

Recently I have been back living in hotel rooms and struggling with managing all my USB devices with the rMPS two ports.

To solve this problem I dug the [Dell D3100 USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station](http://amzn.to/1UEw6iT) back out to use as powered USB 3 hub and what I discovered is DisplayLink have been busy working with Apple to get the DisplayLink drivers to work with OS X El Capitan.

Without installing any drivers the rMBP has built-in support for the D3100 features:
* USB hub
  * 3 x SuperSpeed USB 3.0 - 9 pin USB Type A
  * 2 X USB 2.0 - 4 pin USB Type A
* Headphones - mini-stereo 3.5 mm
* Audio out - mini-stereo 3.5 mm
* Gigabit Ethernet - RJ-45

Once the DisplayLink drivers are installed into OS X El Capitan, the D3100 supports:
* 2 x Full HD Monitors,
* 1 x Ultra HD 4K Monitor.

Through the combination of the D3100 and the rMBP (with R9 M370X) you can run a quadruple/pentuple 4K monitor setup!  Time to buy some more monitors :P
