The Pluralsight course [C# Collections Fundamentals (2014/04/08)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-collections), published on 8 April 2014 is given by [Simon Robinson](https://techiesimon.com) and is part of the [C# Learning Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/csharp) - [review](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-learning-path.md).

Overview
--------
The course is made up of the chapters:
* Course Welcome
* Introducing C# Collections
* Inside Arrays
* The Array Type
* Collection Interfaces
* Lists
* Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Enumerators
* Multidimensional Arrays, Rank and Bounds

This course takes a very similar approach to the Pluralsight course: [C# Collections Fundamentals (2014/04/08)](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-collections-fundamentals-2014-04-08.md) which is not surprising as both course are given by [Simon Robinson](https://techiesimon.com).

The first half of the course is focused on high-level collection theory, which brought back memories of classes during my [Electronics & Software Engineering undergraduate degree at Glasgow University](http://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/electronicsoftwareengineering/#/).  The second half is showing how these collections are provided by the .NET Framework.  It was fun to go through this material however, the course feels like video documentation and relies on the student to understand when they will make use of the details.
