The Pluralsight course [C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015 (2015/09/25)](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015), published on 25 September 2015 is given by [Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com) and is part of the [C# Learning Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/csharp) - [review](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-learning-path.md).

Overview
--------
Scott is an excellent instructor and I always enjoy his courses.  The chapters of this course are:
* An Introduction to C# and .NET
* Classes and Objects
* Assemblies
* Types
* Methods, Fields, Events, and Properties
* Control Flow
* Object Oriented Programming

As an experienced C# developer, as expected there was nothing new for me.  With an eye towards a new developer, overall I was pleased that all of the core C# features are introduced along with unit testing and refactoring.  I do have a couple of concerns that I think could face a new developer:
* No one to talk to
* Unit tests are not carried through the course
* Not all concepts are cemented with examples

### No one to talk to
This is more a general comment about using an online self-paced training course and my own assumptions.  However, I think that if this was your first introduction to development, while this course is useful I think that a true novice will progress much quicker working with an experienced developer.

### Unit tests are not carried through the course
I was delighted that Scott introduces unit testing in the third chapter (Assemblies).  My concern is that Scott does not use this approach for the rest of the course.  There is also a reasonable section through  chapters 5 (Methods, Fields, Events, and Properties) and 6 (Control Flow) where the unit tests no longer work.  While I suspect that most novices will not re-run the unit tests, anyone who does will be left with breaking tests.  Any student who does this may loose a lot of time re-watching the course, checking their code, potentially making random changes while believing they have done something wrong.

### Not all concepts are cemented with an examples
Not all concepts are cemented with examples, with chapter 6 (Control Flow) sticking out in my mind.  There are a lot of keywords introduced to the student without supporting examples.  Correctly the [Learning Check](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015/learning-check) tests the student on these however, without the examples I believe a novice will struggle.

Final thoughts
--------------
Overall I think that this is a pretty good introduction to Visual Studio 2015 and C#.  I look forward to working through the course with my kids.
