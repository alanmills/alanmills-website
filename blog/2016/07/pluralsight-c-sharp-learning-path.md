Pluralsight has introduced Learning paths and I have decided to go through the [C# Learning Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/csharp) to see what it is like and hopefully learn some new things.

I first started working with C# when .NET was released of the [public beta 1](http://news.microsoft.com/2000/11/13/microsoft-announces-availability-of-visual-studio-net-and-net-framework-beta-1-submits-c-to-ecma/#sm.0000hhm6mt17yen5y9r1lmh79zszb) towards the end of 2000.  And was working with C#, VB.NET, .NET Framework and Visual Studio day-to-day from Beta 1 to 3.0.  

After this I have been working in other technologies and management roles and during this time I have been very interested in the skills development of the teams I have been leading.  To this end I am currious if an-online training course can take you from novice to expert.  As an experienced developer it is going to be difficult to really get into the shoes of a complete novice however, I plan to tackle this by encouraging my kids to come on this journey with me.

Path Structure
--------------
The learning path is structured into skills levels, with multiple courses per level.

* [Beginner](Beginner)

  * C# Equality and Comparisons - [review](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-equality-and-comparisons-2014-09-10.md)
  * C# Collections Fundamentals - [review](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-collections-fundamentals-2014-04-08.md)
* [Intermediate](intermediate)

  * C# Best Practices: Collections and Generics
  * C# Events, Delegates and Lambdas
  * C# Extension Methods
  * Practical LINQ
  * Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals in C#
  * Defensive Coding in C#
* [Advanced](advanced)
  * Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in .NET
  * C# Concurrent Collections
  * C# Tips and Traps
  * C# Tips and Traps 2
  * C# Language Internals - Part 1
  * C# Language Internals - Part 2

Beginner
--------
After completing the beginner courses, to a total beginner to software development I would not recommend the learning path.  The first course [C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015-2015-09-25.md) is an okay starting point however, for me it is missing the construction of an application.

Following the [C# Fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015-2015-09-25.md), the next two courses are very theoretical and felt like language documentation in video form.  

For an experienced developer coming to C# then these will help you get up to speed with some of the tools and semantics however, I think a single course focusing on a transition journey would be better.  I believe this is what the [Android for .NET Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/android-dotnet-developers-getting-started) courses are aiming to achieve however, going from C# to Android development.

There is a range of courses that I think look interesting that maybe better for the new developer:
* [Become a Full-stack .NET Developer](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer-fundamentals)
* [Become a Full-stack .NET Developer - Advanced Topics](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer)
* [Become a Full-stack .NET Developer - Architecture and Testing](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer-architecture-testing)
