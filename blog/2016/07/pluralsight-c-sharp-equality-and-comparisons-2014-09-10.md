The Pluralsight course [C# Equality and Comparisons](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-equality-comparisons), published on 10 September 2014 is given by [Simon Robinson](https://techiesimon.com) and is part of the [C# Learning Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/csharp) - [review](blog/2016/07/pluralsight-c-sharp-learning-path.md).

Overview
--------

The chapters of this course are:
* Why Is Equality So Hard?
* Equality in .NET
* The C# Equality Operator
* Implementing Equality for Value Types
* Implementing Equality for Reference Types
* Comparisons in .NET
* Equality and Comparisons for Strings
* Comparers and Equality Comparers
* Hash Codes and Hashtables
* Structural Equality and Comparisons

This is a really good course that covers the key points on consuming and adding Equality and Comparison capabilities to your own classes and structs.  To get the most out of this course, follow along with the code examples and experiment.  I personally would have enjoyed the course more if all of the different equality and comparisons discussed were built in to the working project built throughout the course.
