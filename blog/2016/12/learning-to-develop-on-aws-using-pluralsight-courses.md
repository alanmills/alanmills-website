**Status**: Draft

While I have superficially kept an eye on AWS over the years, the majority of my attention has been on Azure.  During August 2016 I joined Informa Business Intelligence as a Technology Architect.  Informa is predominately using AWS as their cloud provider and therefore, in order to make effective decisions I need to get a much deeper understanding of AWS.

As usual I like to see what resources Pluralsight has to offer.  Pluralsight have defined a learning path called [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/aws-certified-devops-engineer).  This course is as the title suggests, getting you ready for the [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/) exam.  Like the certification, the learning path presumes that you have significant experience with AWS.

Unfortunately, Pluralsight do not provide learning paths for the associated exams:
* [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)
* [AWS Certified Developer Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/)

After digging Pluralsight, looking at the available courses I have put together my own learning path from zero to AWS Certified DevOps Engineer.
