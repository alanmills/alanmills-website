While I have superficially kept an eye on AWS over the years, the majority of my attention has been on Azure.  During August 2016 I joined Informa Business Intelligence as a Technology Architect.  Informa is predominately using AWS as their cloud provider and therefore, in order to make effective decisions I need to get a much deeper understanding of AWS.

As usual I like to see what resources Pluralsight has to offer.  Pluralsight have defined a learning path called [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/aws-certified-devops-engineer).

Path Structure
--------------
The learning path is made up of four courses that align up to the four domains covered in the exam:
* AWS Certified DevOps Engineer: Continuous Delivery and Automation - [review](blog/2016/11/pluralsight-docker-and-containers-the-big-picture-2015-12-22.md)
* AWS Certified DevOps Engineer: Monitoring, Metrics, and Logging
* AWS Certified DevOps Engineer: Security, Governance, and Validation
* AWS Certified DevOps Engineer: High Availability and Elasticity

Exam is 170 minutes Logging with the percentage of questions coming from the four domains:
* 55% - Continuous Delivery and Automation
* 20% - Monitoring, Metrics, and Logging
* 10% - Security, Governance, and Validation
* 15% - High Availability and Elasticity


Before you can complete the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer you need to have completed either of the associated exams:
* [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)
