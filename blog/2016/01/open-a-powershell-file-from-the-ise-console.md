When working from the console (Ctrl+D) in the Windows PowerShell ISE (Interactive Scripting Environment) if you want to open a file for editing without using the ISE Chrome (Ctrl+O), you can run the ```PS> psEdit script.ps1``` command to open the script into the Script Pane (Ctrl+I)

** Example **
``` PowerShell
PS C:\scripts>  psEdit .\myscript.ps1
```
