I have decided to build my own website from scratch instead of making use of any popular blog services. Now you can call me crazy for doing this and normally I would agree however, like lots of developers I am writing this for my own learning tool.  As I progress into the world of [MAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAMP).  Once I have gone through this exercise I will probably migrate to a popular open source or commercial solution as maintaining my own solution is probably a poor long-term solution.

My motivation for working with MAMP is outlined in the post [Goodbye Microsoft, hello MAMP](/blog/2014/05/goodbye-microsoft.md). Therefore I have decided to leverage the following tools and services to build [alanmills.info](/):

* Browser technologies: [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/html5/), [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-roadmap-20010523/) & [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
* Server side development: [Python](https://www.python.org),
* Development tool: [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/),
* Version control and issue tracking: [gitHub](https://github.com),
* Cloud hosting: [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/),
* Domain registration: [Hover](https://hover.com/WFvd9zHJ).

To cover all of the steps to bring [alanmills.info](/) online would be an extremely long post.  To allow you to jump to the sections that interest you, I have split the process in to the following posts:
* [Setting up IntelliJ to work with Google App Engine and gitHub](/blog/2014/05/setup-intellij-gae-gitHub.md)
* [Designing alanmills.info](/blog/2014/05/designing-alanmills.info.md)
* [Web deployment from gitHub to Google App Engine](/blog/2014/05/gae-cloud-deployment.md)
* [Configuring Google App Engine and Hover to host alanmills.info](/blog/2014/05/hover-gae.md)
