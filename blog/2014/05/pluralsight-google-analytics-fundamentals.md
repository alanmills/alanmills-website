As someone starting to build my own blog, I am very interested to understand how popular and effective how each blog post is and the blog as a whole.

Over the last 10 years, I have worked in many teams where we have made use of Google Analytics however, I have never personally set it up or work with Google Analytics to make sure we have effective metrics.

Hunting around I found the [Pluralsight: Google Analytics Fundamentals](http://pluralsight.com/training/courses/TableOfContents?courseName=google-analytics&highlight=zoiner-tejada_google-analytics-m5-programming-google-analytics*1,2!zoiner-tejada_google-analytics-m1-introducing-google-analytics*2,3,11,0,12!zoiner-tejada_google-analytics-m4-managing-reports-and-data*1!zoiner-tejada_google-analytics-m3-ecommerce-social-and-campaign-tracking#google-analytics-m5-programming-google-analytics) course.
